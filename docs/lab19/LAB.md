### üíª Lab 19 - Deploying the API

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

#### üìö Learning outcomes:

- Understand how to bootstrap a new Nx workspace

#### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. For this workshop you'll need Docker and the Heroku CLI installed (Docker is optional - it's only if you want to trigger the deployment locally)
2. Chose a unique name for your API and keep track of it. This will determine the address where the API will 
be deployed to as well, for example `https://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com`
3. Run these commands:

```
heroku login
heroku create <the-app-name-you-chose>
heroku authorizations:create <-- remember the "Token" this outputs
```

4. Keep track of the "Token" you got from the above command - we'll use this to login to Heroku from now on
5. Create a new file `apps/api/.local.env`

```
HEROKU_API_KEY=<your-heroku-token>
```

6. Create a new file `apps/api/Dockerfile`

```
FROM node:12-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./ ./
CMD node main.js
```

7. In `workspace.json`, under the **production** build options for the API (`projects -> api -> architect -> build -> configurations -> production`)
add this as an option:

```
"externalDependencies": [
    "@nestjs/microservices",
    "@nestjs/microservices/microservices-module",
    "@nestjs/websockets/socket-module",
    "class-transformer",
    "class-validator",
    "cache-manager"
],
```

The above option tells webpack to bundle all the dependencies with our API, except the ones above (which fail the build if we tell webpack to include).
Normally, it's not recommended to bundle any dependencies with your server bundles,
but in this case it simplifies the deployment process.

8. Add this to the `api` architects array in `workspace.json`:

```
"deploy": {
    "builder": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
        "outputs": [],
        "options": {
        "commands": [
            "cp ../../../apps/api/Dockerfile .",
            "heroku container:login",
            "heroku container:push web -a bg-hoard-api",
            "heroku container:release web -a bg-hoard-api"
        ],
        "cwd": "dist/apps/api",
        "parallel": false
    }
},
```

9. Let's enable CORS on the server so our API can make requests to it (since they'll be deployed in separate places):
    - In `apps/api/src/main.ts`
    - Enable CORS:
    ```
   async function bootstrap() {
     const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
     const globalPrefix = 'api';
     app.setGlobalPrefix(globalPrefix);
     app.enableCors(); <--- ADD THIS
   ```
   
   Normally, you want to restrict this to just a few origins. But to keep things simple in this workshop
   we'll enable it for all origins.
   
10. Run:

```
nx build api --configuration=production
nx deploy api
```

11. Go to `https://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/api/games` - you should see a list of games.
