### üíª Lab 13 - Workspace schematics - Intro

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

#### üìö Learning outcomes:

- Understand what workspace schematics are
- How to create one
- How to invoke them 
- How to simplify usage of an external lib

#### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

1. Generate a workspace schematic:

    ```
    nx generate @nrwl/workspace:workspace-schematic util-lib
    ```

2. Add a new property to its schema:

    ```
    "directory": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The scope of your lib.",
          "x-prompt": "Which directory do you want the lib to be in?",
          "enum": [
            "store",
            "api",
            "none"
          ]
        }
    ```

3. Have it invoke the `@nrwl/workspace:lib` schematic: 

    ```
    "directory": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The scope of your lib.",
          "x-prompt": "Which directory do you want the lib to be in?",
          "enum": [
            "store",
            "api",
            "none"
          ]
        }
    ```

4. Let's invoke it: `nx workspace-schematic util-lib notifications`

5. Add some code to it:

```
export function sendNotification(clientId: string) {
  console.log("sending notification to client: ", clientId);
}
```

6. Now try to import the above function in `apps/api/src/app/app.service.ts`
    - It should work because it is now scoped to `api`
