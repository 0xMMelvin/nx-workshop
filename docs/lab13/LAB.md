### üß∏Ô∏è Lab 13 - Workspace schematics - Intro

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 20-25 minutes

#### üìö Learning outcomes:

- Understand what workspace schematics are
- How to create them
- How to invoke them 
- How to use one to simplify usages of other, more powerful schematics

#### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps :

We just learned how important tags are. But we don't want to constantly and manually 
have to maintain them. In this workshop, we'll create a custom workspace schematic
called `util-lib` that knows about the folders in our workspace and automatically tags the new project
with a correct scope and type tag.

1. Use the `@nrwl/workspace:workspace-schematic` schematic to generate a new
workspace schematic called `util-lib`

2. Commit everything (you'll see in a bit why).

2. Inspect the files that got generated and try to run it.

   Inspect the [Workspace schematics docs](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/workspace/schematics/workspace-schematics#workspace-schematics)
   for details on how to run it.

   ‚ö†Ô∏è It invokes the `@nrwl/workspace:lib` schematic by default. So it might generate some files when you run it.
   You can use Git to undo those changes (hence why it's recommended to commit before running a schematic).

3. Try to make it `console.log()` the value of the `--name` property you passed to it.

2. Add a new property to its schema called `directory`. It should have only 3 possible values:
`"store", "api", "shared"`. If you do not pass `--directory` as an option when invoking the
schema it should prompt the user to select from the 3 different values (similar to when you got 
asked about which CSS framework to use when creating Angular libs).

3. Have the schematic automatically to `--linter=tslint`, so the developer doesn't have
to pass it each time they invoke the schematic.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Continue referring to the doc page linked in the above hints
    
3. The schematic should prefix any name you give to your lib with `util-`
    
    For example: 
    - `nx workspace-schematic util-lib dates`
    - Should generate a lib with the name `util-dates`
    
3. The schematic should generate the lib in the directory you pass to it.

4. Because it's a `util` lib, it should automatically be generated with the `type:util` tags.

       Consult the `@nrwl/workspace:lib` [docs](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/plugins/workspace/schematics/library)
       for possible options you can pass to it.

5. We also need to add `scope` tag to it. We can use the `directory` value for this.

4. Invoke your schematic and test if the above requirements work
    - Let's give it the name `notifications`
    - Select `api` as the directory

6. Let's add some functionality to the lib you just created:
    - In `libs/api/util-notifications/src/lib/api-util-notifications.ts`
    - Add:
   
        ```
       export function sendNotification(clientId: string) {
         console.log("sending notification to client: ", clientId);
       }
       ```

7. Now try to import the above function in `apps/api/src/app/app.service.ts`
    - It should work because it should be scoped to `api`
    
8. Try to import it in `apps/store/src/app/app.component.ts`
    - It should fail as it's from outside its scope.
    
9. In `libs/api/util-notifications/src/lib/api-util-notifications.ts`
    - Try to import a `feature` lib
    - It should correctly fail because the type hierarchy is not respected
